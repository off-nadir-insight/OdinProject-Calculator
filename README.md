## Tasks
[x] basic mathematical operations
  create functions for:
  [x] add
  [x] subtract
  [x] multiply
  [x] divide
[x] function named "operate" that takes an operator & two numbers and calls one of the mathematical functions (from prev step)
[x] create HTML calculator layout
  without "wiring up" the JS:
  [x] button for each digit
  [x] button for each of the functions
  [x] equals button
  [x] display (with dummy numbers)
  [x] clear button
[x] function to populate the display as numbers are pushed
[x] "hook up" functions to buttons
  [x] store the first number
  [x] store the operation
  [x] equals button triggers the operate() function
  [x] update display with the solution
  [x] add functionality to chain operations

[x] EXTRA CREDIT: Add a “backspace” button, so the user can undo if they click the wrong number.
  
  <!-- *** this section will be a challenge *** -->

<!-- additional goals -->

<!-- EXTRA CREDIT: Users can get floating point numbers if they do the math required to get one, but they can’t type them in yet. Add a . button and let users input decimals! Make sure you don’t let them type more than one though: 12.3.56.5. It is hard to do math on these numbers. (disable the decimal button if there’s already one in the display)

EXTRA CREDIT: Make it look nice! This can be a good portfolio project… but not if it’s UGLY. At least make the operations a different color from the keypad buttons.


EXTRA CREDIT: Add keyboard support! -->
